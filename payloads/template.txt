# P4wnP1 payload Template by MaMe82
# ==========================
# Empty payload starting all USB functions
# - USB Mass storage
# - CDC ECM device (Linux ethernet over USB)
# - RNDIS device (Windows ethernet over USB)
# - USB keyboard

# =============================
# USB setup
# =============================
USE_ECM=true            # if true CDC ECM will be enabled
USE_RNDIS=true          # if true RNDIS will be enabled
USE_HID=true            # if true HID (keyboard) will be enabled
USE_UMS=true           # if true USB Mass Storage will be enabled

# ==========================
# Network and DHCP options
# ==========================

# We choose an IP with a very small subnet (see comments in README.rst)
IF_IP="172.16.0.1" # IP used by P4wnP1
IF_MASK="255.255.255.252" 
IF_DHCP_RANGE="172.16.0.2,172.16.0.3" # DHCP Server IP Range


# =====================
# Keyboard config
# =====================
# Keyboard language for outhid and duckhid commands
# possible languages: "be", "br", "ca", "ch", "de", "dk", "es", "fi", "fr", "gb", "hr", "it", "no", "pt", "ru", "si", "sv", "tr", "us"
lang="de"


# This function gets called after the target host enables the network interface
# (RNDIS, CDC ECM or both have to be enabled)
function onNetworkUp()
{
	# commands in this callback function are ran as root
	#
	# available variables:
	#	$IF_IP: 		IP used by P4wnP1
	#	$IF_MASK:		Netmask used by P4wnP1
	#	$IF_DHCP_RANGE:		P4wnP1 DHCP Server IP Range
	#	$active_interface:	Internal network interface in use by P4wnP1 (usb0, usb1 or none)
	#	$wdir:			Absolute path to P4wnP1 main directory
	#
	# available commands:
	#	outhid
	#		Pipe ASCII into this command to output via HID keyboard on target
	#		The output keyboard layout is derived from the "lang" option (Keyboard config)
	#		Note: A newline character (ASCII 0x0A) is interpreted as RETURN key
	#		outhid only works if USE_HID=true
	#
	#		Example: echo "Hello World | outhid"
	#
	#	duckhid
	#		Pipe DuckyScript into this command to output via HID keyboard on target
	#		The output keyboard layout is derived from the "lang" option (Keyboard config)
	#		duckhid only works if USE_HID=true
	#
	#		Example (starting notepad, indents only for readability):
	#			cat << EOF | duckhid
	#			DELAY 500
	#			GUI r
	#			DELAY 500
	#			STRING notepad.exe
	#			ENTER
	#			EOF

}

# this function gets called if the target host received a DHCP lease
# (DHCP client has to be running on target)
function onTargetGotIP()
{
	# commands in this callback function are ran as root
	#
	# available variables:
	#	same as onNetworkUp()
	#
	# additional variables:
	#	$target_ip:	The IP the target host received via its DHCP lease
	#
	# available commands:
	#	same as onNetworkUp()

}

# this function gets called after P4wnP1 finished booting
# Caution: 	This doesn't necessarily mean that "onNetworkUp" or "onTargetGotIP"
#		have already been called
function onBootFinished()
{
	# commands in this callback function are ran as user root
}

# commands in this function are ran if the user pi logs in (SSH or local)
function onLogin()
{
	# commands in this callback function are ran as user pi
